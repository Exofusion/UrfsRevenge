# Urf's Revenge

## Synopsis

Urf's Revenge is a 2D platform shooter, using League of Legends API data to procedurally generate enemies. The game client is built in the freely available Unity Engine, with a Python script hosted on Google App Engine to power the API requests.

## Installation

The only program required to build the game is the Unity Engine (http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).  Simply clone the repository, tell Unity to open an existing project, and select the local repository directory.  Once the project has been opened, you can use Unity to build to any number of targets.  For development, the Web Player and WebGL Preview were targeted.

## Authors

This project is the product of the combined efforts of Ben Fischer and Ronnie Blackburn, for the Riot API coding challenge.
